### üöÄ Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (√ó), and Division (√∑).
- **Chained Calculations:** Ability to perform continuous operations (e.g., `5 + 5 √ó 2 = 20`).
- **Functional Buttons:** Includes `AC` (All Clear), `‚å´` (Backspace/Delete), and `%` (Percentage).
- **Decimal Support:** Capable of performing calculations with decimal numbers using the dot (.) button.

### üíª Technologies & Concepts Applied

This project served as a practical exercise for a wide range of core technologies and concepts, including:

- **HTML5:** Using a clean and semantic document structure.
- **CSS3:**
    - **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Designing for mobile first and adapting to larger screens.
    - **CSS Grid:** Utilized to create a precise and responsive calculator keypad layout.
    - **Flexbox:** Employed for content alignment within the display and other components.
    - **`aspect-ratio`:** A modern technique to create proportional, square buttons.
    - **Responsive Units (`vh`):** For setting the display height relative to the screen.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):**
    - **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting and dynamically manipulating HTML elements.
    - **Event Handling:** Managing all user inputs through `addEventListener`.
    - **State Management:** Managing the calculator's "memory" (`current`, `previous`, `operation`) to handle complex calculation logic.
    - **Functions & Logic:** Breaking down the code into reusable functions (`updateDisplay`, `compute`, `clear`).
    - **Error Handling:** Basic logic to prevent division by zero.

### üí° Development Process & Lessons Learned

This project was an intensive problem-solving journey. The main challenge was designing a robust state management system to handle various user input scenarios, such as chained calculations and input corrections with backspace. The process of *refactoring* the code by separating logic into helper functions like `compute()` and `updateDisplay()` taught me the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
